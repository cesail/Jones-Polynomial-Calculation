# Jones-Polynomial-Calculation

## Overview
Jones polynomial is a knot invariant.
This jupyter notebook walks through the steps to calculate the jones polynomial of a knot
 by realizing the diagram of the knot as the Penrose graphical notion of a certain subcategory of the tensor category $$U_q(sl_2)$$-mod.
### Roadmap
This project is a work in progress. The following are planned improvements.
- [ ] Fix the q^3 factor issue
- [ ] Integrate the algorithm into a Django web application that allow users to drag graphical components to complete the diagram of a knot and get its Jones Polynomial
